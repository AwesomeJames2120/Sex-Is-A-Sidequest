go into options and make sure script mods are enabled
if you dont do this then i reserve the right to laugh at you

# Pre installation
Due to the wonders of the sites people use to host sims 4 mods, a lot of them can't seem to actually be downloaded via wabbajack. Its cringe. Because of this, you will need to download the following manually, and place them in the folder that wabbajack will put the rest of the downloads in. (I may also be stupid, keep this in mind)

You will also need to run your sims 4 at least once so that the paths get set up correctly

# Actual Installation

Open the wabbajack file for this modlist, then set the paths for where you want the modlist installed, and the path to the folder containing the above files. The end result should look something like this![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44416823/178158104-e17e8c3f-389f-436a-9950-a5493881ca34.png)
